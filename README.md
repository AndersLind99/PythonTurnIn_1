# PythonTurnIn_1

Uploaded the folder I made in juptyter, which should contain all the files needed to check the handin code.

for this turn in, its Turn in nr 1.ipynb. that contains my work.


# PythonTurnIn_2

had to do most the work in VS code to make it work with selenium, so unsure how well this will work on other machines.
everything should be in the assingment 2 folder
